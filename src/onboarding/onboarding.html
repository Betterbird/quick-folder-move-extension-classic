          <h1>Quick Folder Move</h1>
          <p>
            Welcome to Quick Folder Move! Getting to inbox zero can be difficult. There are many
            emails to triage, and it takes time to read and reply to each. Quick Folder Move is
            meant to reduce the time between email. Those few extra clicks to move the message in a
            folder might not seem much, but with the amount of emails you receive every day it can
            add up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's see how to make best use of this add-on!

            <h2>Moving in context</h2>
            <p>
              On each message, there is a button that will allow you to move or copy emails to a
              folder of your choice. Once you are in the popup, you can use the following to navigate:
            </p>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Left/Right Arrow</b>: Switch between 'move' and 'copy' modes.</li>
                <li><b>Search box</b>: Use this to search for part of the folder name. You might only need 1-2 letters!</li>
                <li><b>Down Arrow</b>: Move between the search box and the folder items.</li>
                <li><b>Enter</b>: When you've picked the folder you'd like, press enter to move the message. If it is the first folder, press enter right away.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section image-right">
          <img src="images/shortcuts.png" alt="Managing shortcuts in the add-ons manager" />
          <div class="text">
            <h2>The keys to boost your speed</h2>
            <p>
              Navigating with the keyboard is not confined to the popup. Ideally, you don't want to
              leave your keyboard when filing messages. Using the following shortcuts, you can take
              action on an email immediately:
            </p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Ctrl+Shift+M</b>: Open the popup to move the selected email message.</li>
                <li><b>Ctrl+Shift+C</b>: Open the popup to copy the selected email message.</li>
                <li><b>Ctrl+Shift+G</b>: Go to a different folder quickly.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              You can customize the keyboard shortcuts in the add-on manager to your liking. If
              you've used this add-on in the past please note Shift+M is no longer available due to
              restrictions in Thunderbird.
