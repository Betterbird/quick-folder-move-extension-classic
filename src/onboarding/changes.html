          <h1>Quick Folder Move</h1>
          <p>
            Welcome to your updated Quick Folder Move, now fully compatible with Thunderbird 115.
            With this update comes a few adjustments that might reshape your workflow. To keep you
            in the loop, let's delve into these changes and keep any surprises at bay.
          </p>
          <p>
            This version adopts a newer extensions technology (MailExtensions),
            which promises greater stability. This means you can carry on using this add-on version
            even with future Thunderbird updates without a hitch.
          </p>
          <p>
            The flipside, though, is that this new technology doesn't support every customization
            that you're used to. But don't worry, the following sections will guide you on adapting
            your workflow to this new version. Enjoy your updated Quick Folder Move!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section image-right">
          <img src="images/toolbar.png" alt="Popup showing in the main toolbar" />
          <div class="text">
            <h2>All in one place</h2>
            <p>
              In the previous version, you had a variety of ways to launch the Quick Folder Move
              popup—from the message context menu to keyboard shortcuts. The location of the popup
              would vary, depending on what elements of the UI were active at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, your workflow is more streamlined. Use the button in the main toolbar no matter
              if you want to move, copy or go to a folder. This change makes your navigation more
              straightforward and less cluttered.
            </p>

        </div>
        <div class="section image-left">
          <img src="images/new-button.png" alt="New location for the button" />
          <div class="text">
            <h2>Moving in context</h2>
            <p>
              In addition to the main toolbar button, you also have the option to move messages
              directly from the message header. This way you'll be able to take action right in
              context, and you'll be ready to tackle the next message without delay.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section image-right">
          <img src="images/shortcuts.png" alt="Managing shortcuts in the add-ons manager" />
          <div class="text">
            <h2>Changing Muscle Memory</h2>
            <p>
              The new technology restricts available keyboard shortcuts to prevent unexpected
              command changes. This means we'll bid farewell to Shift+M, welcoming Ctrl+Shift+M for
              'move' instead. Copy and Goto have undergone the same change.
            </p>
            <p>
              But you're not without options. You can tweak these shortcuts in the add-on manager,
              and this version still allows for the old shortcuts. Revert back to the legacy
              shortcuts in this <a id="openOptions" href="about:addons">add-on's preferences</a>,
              or <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/manage-extension-shortcuts-firefox" target="_blank">use the shortcut manager</a>
              to define your own.
            </p>

              <label>
                <input type="radio" name="shortcuts" value="new" checked>
                Embracing change, I'm testing new shortcuts or tailoring them in the prefs.
              </label>
              <label>
                <input type="radio" name="shortcuts" value="legacy">
                Change is hard. I'll stick with the old shortcuts for now.
              </label>
