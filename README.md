Quick Folder Move - Classic Version
===================================

This is the source code for [Quick Folder Move](https://www.betterbird.eu/addons/),
an add-on to quickly move emails into other folders in Thunderbird and Betterbird.
The main purpose is to use the keyboard for triaging emails, but of course you can also click on things.

* **Shift+M** opens a context menu that allows you to move the currently selected messages to another folder
* **Shift+Y** opens a context menu that allows you to copy the currently selected messages to another folder
* **Shift+G** opens a context menu that allows you to navigate to the folder you've entered

This is a fork of the [original Quick Folder Move](https://github.com/kewisch/quickmove-extension/) by Philipp Kewisch.
We forked it to maintain the original WebExtension **Experiment** version as shipped for Thunderbird/Betterbird 91 and 102
for as long as possible.

Download the add-on from the [Betterbird add-ons page](https://www.betterbird.eu/addons/).
